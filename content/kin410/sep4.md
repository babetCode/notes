What is plp1: Peer Lecture Presentations to be recorded.

NSCA must be renewed every 3 years.

### Summary topics:
- hand grips, where to grip the bar
- stable body positioning
- how to breathe relative to the "sticking point"
- proper use to fransient breath holding
- proper use of a wieght belt
- proper use of spotters
- alternatives when spotters are not available

### What is the "Best" Resistance training program?
- there is no such thisn as the "best" set of lifts for all people.
- there is no such thisn as the "best" combination of reps and sets.
- there is no such thisn as the "best" training program.
- the "best" training program for any individual is highly individualized and evolves over time.
- Every training program is based on a set of overarching principles.
- the "best" program for any individual changes with training, changes with setbacks (injury), and with age.

### overarching principles of training
- specificity:
    - training outcomes (adaptations) are expected to be specific to the type of training.
- resistance trainign specificity:
    - muscles trained
    - type and speed of muscle contractions
    - movement patterns

Need of an athelete change throughout the seasons and should not be sthe same throughout an entire year.. this will be mentioned with periodization

- Overload
    - refers to the training program being of greater intesity that that to which the athlete is currently accustomed.
    - without overload the body has "no reason" to adapt. i.e. alarm stage of [GAS (general adaptation syndrome)](https://www.google.com/search?q=general+adaptation+syndrome&oq=general+adaptation+syndrome&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAtIBCDQwNjdqMGoxqAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

Fore a complete novice, one exposure to stimulus can trigger adaptation. for experienced individuals, higher insult is necessary. THis will be explored in ch. 17
- Resistanc training overload includes
    - progression of resistance/ste training load
    - adding exercise
    - chancing amount of raest between sets and/or lifts.
    - increasing the complexity of the exercise
    - incresing training frequency

- Progression:
    - refers ot how a training program should continually increase load or change loads to promote relatively continuous inprovement in outcomes
- Resistance training progression
    - uses the tools of overload to systematically and continuously change the training stimulus to derive the maximum benefit from the expected adaptations

exam 2 will be on standardized tests, and will be the subject of plp 2

### Program design viriables:

- 1 ) needs analysis
    - motivation/ reason to be there
    - background
    - Two stage process:
        - evaluate requirements and characteristics of the sport
            - movement analysis
                - what movement patterns are necessary?
            - physiological analysis
                - primary aerobic or primary anaerobic?
            - injury analysis
                - common sites of injury, inj. mechanicsms, & populations specific concern.
- 2 ) exercise selection
- 3 ) training frequency
- 4 ) exercise order
- 5 ) training load and repetitions
- 6 ) training volume
- 7 ) rest periods
