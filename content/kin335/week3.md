## Deformation of tissue

## Loading on tissue

- Axial
    - compression
    - tension
- Shear
    - also along one axis, but in opposite directions (and missaligned)

- Multi-axial
    - bening
    - torsion *why?*

slipped femoral capital epiphisys examples

*ACL is less taut with knee flexion*

**Stress:** force per unit area. Area is measured over plane normal to force vector.

**Strain:** change in dimension/shape.

how does young's modulus differ from slope?

**Comminuted:** *Medicine* (of a fracture) producing multiple bone splinters.

*Why can tissue withstand more strain than it's maximum load before fracture?*

Load - deformation curve vs. stress - strain curve (basically the same for our purposes)

**"stiffness** of tissue (basically its spring constant) produces linear stress-strain curve in elastic region.

Acute inflammatory process will likely begin around plastic deformation point of tissue.

*Strain curve shows muscle stretching more than ligament (how does this stack up agains Seifert's claim that tendon stretches more than muscle?)*

why is rate of load in bone measured in MegaPascal's per second

**resilience:** Ability to endure loads within elastic limits

**toughness:** area under entire curve.

- **stiffness**
- **strength**
- **elasticity**
- ductility
- brittleness
- maleability
- toughness
- resilience
