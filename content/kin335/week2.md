## Acute inflammatory process

- **injury** (lasts several minutes)
    - soft tissue & vascular damage
    - vasoconstriction
    - damaged cells release chemical mediators including cytokines
- **acute** (acute phase of acute inflammation begins within a few minutes and lasts up to 3-4 days)
    - vasodilation and blood vessel wall permeability increases
    - WBC (neutrophils & macrophages) are released into the injured region
    - it's important to protect and localize inflamation
    - Visual symptoms
        - redness & heat (from increased circulation)/swelling (from more plasma)/pain (some from initial injury, increased sensitivity, some from swelling pressure), bruising (from initial injury tearing microvasculature, leading to blood pooling)
- **destruction**
    - cytokines signal WBC
    - White blood cells & phagocytes degrade injured tissue
    - once completely surrounded, lysosome is released by WBCs.
    - systemic symptoms:
        - fever --- *not usually after musculoskeletal injury, if after surgery it's probably due to infections*
        - pain
        - malaise
        - increased WBCs
        - Enlarged lymph nodes
- **repair & modeling**
    - lasts between 48 hrs - 6 weeks, depending on severity of injury. *Mild MCL sprain example of 6 week repair*
    - turns into normal tissue, but very dissorganized (fibers may not be aligned for example)
- **maturation**

*Note:* Lost sleep causes increased risk of injury --- but later

*Gransulation tissue* --- scar tissue  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new granulation tissue is more red
