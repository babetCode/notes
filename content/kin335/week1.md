## inflamatory response

### Acute
healthy response to appropriate insult (infection, laceratoin, sprain, etc...) happens within seconds of injury

**Main Causes:**
- Physical Trauma
- Chemical Agents
- Thermal Extremes
- etc... (more listed on lecture slides)

**Phases of Acute Inflamation:**
- injury (lasts several minutes)
    - soft tissue & vascular damage
    - vasoconstriction
    - damaged cells release chemical mediators including cytokines
- acute (acute phase of acute inflammation begins within a few minutes and lasts up to 3-4 days)
    - vasodilation and blood vessel wall permeability increases
    - WBC (neutrophils & macrophages) are released into the injured region
    - it's important to protect and localize inflamation
    - Visual symptoms
        - redness & heat (from increased circulation)/swelling (from more plasma)/pain (some from initial injury, increased sensitivity, some from swelling pressure), bruising (from initial injury tearing microvasculature, leading to blood pooling)
- destruction
- repair & modeling
    - begins around 48 to 72 hours and typically lasts around 6 weeks
- maturation

### Chronic
Unhealthy and complicated response

**Case example:** obese diabetic fractures ankle could lead to chronic inflamation due to poor extremity circulation
