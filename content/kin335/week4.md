## Soft Tissue Functions

- deformation
- fatigue resistance
- tear/fracture resistance

**Crimping:** part of stress strain curve
occurs in "toe region" with no tension. This occurs in collagen dense tissues. What is the purpose of this???

## building blocks of soft tissue

- **Collagen:**
    - tensile strength
- **Elastin:**
    - tissue extensibility
- **Proteoglycans & glycosamino-glycans:**
    - allows cartilage to take on compressive load without fracturing

**Multi-level structure:** alter material properties of a tissue, add strenght, hard to create synthetically

    B --> C(fibril);
    C --> D(fiber);
```


**isotropy:** homogeneity in all directions

**Anisotropic tissues** different physical properties along differenc axes.

*why is collagen more organized in ligaments than tendons?*

*Do collagen fibers have "cross-bridges"???*
