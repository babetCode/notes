title: 'Intro'

- **Basic Intro:**
    - name
    - major
    - year in school
    - where I'm from
- **Netiquette Reflection:**
    - one netiquette rule that stood out to me was no. 8 "If you ask a question and many people respond, summarize all answers and post that summary to benefit your whole class."
- **Stress + Coping:**
    - One thing that's currently causing me stress is realizing that even though the canvas calendar shows this assignment being due on aug 31st, and the announcemnt from aug 21st says this is due on the 31st, the assignment description actually says the video was due on wednesday the 27th. To manage this stress, I'm drafting an email to ask proffessor Heiser what I can do to make up these points.
- **Looking Ahead:**
    - This semester, I'm looking forward to make progress in finding a career path after college, and graduate in december.
- **Goals for the Class:**
    - In this class, I'm interested to learn when stress increases performance and when stress decreases performance, especially in the context of stress arousal reappraisal, where mindset can affect how stress impacts performance.
