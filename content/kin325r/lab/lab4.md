$$F = m\cdot a,$$
so we can substitute $$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$$
to get $$F = \frac{m\cdot\Delta v}{\Delta t},$$
and rearrange to
$$F \Delta t = m \Delta v,$$
so impulse equals momentum. We can check that the units match up with
$$\begin{align*}
\text N \cdot \text s &= \text{Kg} \cdot \text m \cdot \text s^{-1} \\\
\end{align*}.$$
Now we can calculate take-off velocity with $$\Delta v = \frac{F \Delta t}{m}.$$
We can then use velocity to calculate kinetic energy with $$KE = \frac12mv^2.$$
Since this will be converted to gravitational potential energy during the jump, we will have $$KE = \frac12mv^2 = GPE = mg \Delta h.$$
substituting \(g = 9.81\) and dividing my the mass gives $$v^2/2 = 9.81 \Delta h$$
which rearranges to $$\Delta h = v^2/19.62.$$
