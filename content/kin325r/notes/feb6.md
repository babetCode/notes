office hours for lab 2 write up:
- isaac friday 12 - 2 pm
- Allie Monday 10am - noon
- Jim Monday 3 - 5 pm
- Ethan Tuesday 5 - 7 pm

suggestions for lab 2:
- is there a difference in bicep muscle forces across angles?
- does the force applied predict bicep muscle force?

*ideas:*
- isometric holds are good for strength training
- rehabilitation is a application where joint load is important to manage

methods will probably be 2 paragraphs  
1 for participants  
1 for protocol

microfet 2 or ergo fet by hoggan salt lake city utah

confidence interval adjustment: choose bonferoni (distributes 0.05 value across all trials)

*sidac* is less strict, *LSD* is least strict

*omnibus test:* was there or was there not a difference between trials?

If ANOVA shows statistically significant difference, then include R^2 value.
