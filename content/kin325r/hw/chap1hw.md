**Abstract:**
> The present study was conducted to biomechanics data on snowboard riding in order to help the improvement of the performance of the members of the national snowboarding team. Based on the results of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn. In neutral positions, the ‘up’motions were taken in which the heights of the right and left hips were relatively the highest and at the moments of turns in both directions, ‘down’motions were taken in which the heights of the right and left hips were relatively the lowest. During front side turns, the right ankle angle became smaller than the left ankle angle so that the toe edge moved deeper into the snow. Muscle activity during front side turns, the right vastus intermedius muscle, the right biceps femoris muscle, the right gastrocnemius muscle, and the right anterior tibial muscle were shown to be major activated muscles. During backside turns, the right vastus lateralis muscle, the right vastus intermedius muscle, the left biceps femoris muscle, and the right anterior tibial muscle (12.64%) were observed as major activated muscles. Plantar pressure analysis during front side turns, the largest vertical force and plantar pressure acted on the left front food and the right hind foot. During backside turns, the largest vertical force and plantar pressure acted on the left hind foot and the right hind foot. In further studies, the comparison of positions in successive turns is recommended.

**How I think this article represents biomechanics being applied:** Biomechanics is the study of mechanics as it relates to living organisms. Mechanics is the study of movements and the forces that caused them. Since this research paper studied the forces produced during snowboarding and their resultant movements, this is an application of biomechanics to the field of snowboarding.
