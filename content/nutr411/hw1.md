1) Use the online calculator for the Harris-Benedict equation to determine your energy needs for each activity level below: http://manytools.org/handy/bmr-calculator/go

*[For your own information and comparison if you would like to see more than one method, Dietary Reference Intakes for estimated energy expenditure may be found in Table C.6 on page 531 of your textbook (only goes up to 5.9 feet in height) or at this link: [https://www.nal.usda.gov/humannutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator](https://www.nal.usda.gov/humannutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator)]*

Enter the total energy expenditure (Daily Calorie Needs) into Table 1. **You must identify each activity level value used to calculate TEE for sedentary, low active, active, and very active (i.e. 1.2 for sedentary, etc.) within the table. Example calculation if TEE = 2000 kcal: CHO of 45% = 2000 kcal * 0.45 = 900 kcal; 900 kcal/4 kcal/g = 225 g.** Calculate and enter ranges (lower to upper quantity) for both kilocalories and grams. Show full calculation with units for one of the two calculations performed for each of carbohydrate, fat, and protein.

**Table 1.** Estimation of energy and macronutrient needs/ranges for identified activity levels.

| Activity level | TEE (kcal/day) | CHO (45-65%) Kcal & grams | FAT (20-35%) Kcal & grams | PRO (10-35%) Kcal & grams | Fiber (g) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sedentary (1.2) | x,xxx kcal/day | xx-xx Kcal xx-xx grams | xx-xx Kcal xx-xx grams | xx-xx Kcal xx-xx grams |  |
| Low Active (1.5) | x,xxx kcal/day | xx-xx Kcal xx-xx grams | xx-xx Kcal xx-xx grams | xx-xx Kcal xx-xx grams |  |
| Active (1.7) | x,xxx kcal/day | xx-xx Kcal xx-xx grams | xx-xx Kcal xx-xx grams | xx-xx Kcal xx-xx grams |  |
| Very Active (2.0) | x,xxx kcal/day | xx-xx Kcal xx-xx grams | xx-xx Kcal xx-xx grams | xx-xx Kcal xx-xx grams |  |
| Actual diet | x,xxx kcal/day | xx Kcal xx grams | xx Kcal xx grams | xx Kcal xx grams | xx.x g |
| Target diet | x,xxx kcal/day | xx Kcal xx grams | xx Kcal xx grams | xx Kcal xx grams | xx.x g |

2) Use MyFitnessPal to enter a typical diet day for you and paste the report into the assignment
template.

3) Use MyFitnessPal to create a one-day diet that meets macronutrient target ranges and that also meets the Recommendations for a Healthy Diet and Lifestyle (textbook chapter 2) for an “active” or “very active” level (total for the day must fall within the ranges for carbohydrate, fat, and protein from Table 1). The diet should be plausible for you, i.e. consist of food that you might actually eat and organized and presented in a way that consists of meals and snacks. A simple list of foods that meet the requirements is not sufficient.

4) List of at least 6 foods that were removed from and or added to your typical diet to increase your compliance with Recommendations for a Healthy Diet and Lifestyle and detailed explanation (one solid paragraph for each of the 6) of at least one potential health benefit linked to that dietary change. Use information from lectures and textbook pages 39-61 to support your answers. For example, “Replacing food x with food y decreases the amount of saturated fat and increases the amount of polyunsaturated fat. Saturated fats are [ ] and polyunsaturated fats are [ ]. Making this change lowers saturated fat from a to b, and increases polyunsatured fats from c to d. The dietary recommendation is to [ ]. This is a healthy change because saturated fats are known to [ ], and polyunsaturated fats are known to [ ] . This change is good for promoting [ ] and decreasing the likelihood of [ ].” While there may be additional information about health benefits of food that you are aware of that are not from class or the textbook, stick to the class information for this assignment. The purpose of this section is to convey your understanding of the concepts and material from chapter 2 of the textbook and relevant information from lectures. One substantive paragraph with a detailed explanation for each of the six foods is required.

**<u>What to include in the diet record:</u>**
Information that should be included in the description of the diet that you develop should include the type and quantity of foods and beverages consumed, method of preparation, and when eaten.

1. <u>Food Items:</u>
Record every food item that you eat. Be as specific as possible about the nature of the food. Specify brand names when appropriate. Record condiments added to the foods (e.g. mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, butter, margarine, salt, oils, etc.).

2. <u>Food Mixtures:</u>
For mixtures of foods (e.g. casseroles, stir-fry dishes, or salads) record ingredients separately. Record all beverages that you would consume, including water. Indicate whether beverages such as coffee, tea, and soda pop are caffeinated or decaffeinated. Include amounts and types of alcoholic beverages and mixes.

3. <u>Method of preparation:</u>
Indicate how food items are prepared. Will they be cooked in butter, margarine, vegetable oil, or with non-stick cooking spray?

4. <u>Quantity consumed:</u>
You need to specify the quantity of each food and beverage to be consumed. Record either in household measurements (cups, teaspoons, tablespoons, etc.) or by weight (grams or ounces). Tip: Look on food the labels of food packaging for this information. NOTE: Make sure you understand the difference between “dry weight” and “fluid volume”. For example, one cup of dry cereal is equal to ~2-3 oz. (depending on the cereal), NOT 8 oz. (which is 1 fluid cup for water). If you record the cup of cereal that you consumed as 8 ounces your energy intake will be grossly overestimated.

5. <u>Guidelines for determining and recording portion sizes:</u>

* Describe fruit size with terms such as large, medium, or small.
* A piece of meat about the size of a deck of cards or the palm of a hand weighs ~ 3 ounces.
* A chicken wing contains about 1 ounce meat; a drumstick or thigh about 2-3 ounces of meat, half of a chicken breast contains ~ 3-4 ounces of meat.
* A handful of chips or pretzels (e.g. the amount in a snack size bag, or 12-15 total pieces) are about 1 oz.

<u>Computer entry and analysis used to develop your diets:</u>
Using the online website, [myfitnesspal.com](myfitnesspal.com), enter your diet that you have created to cover your TEE. The steps are listed below: Entering your Food Intake:
* Go to www.myfitnesspal.com
* If you do not already have an account, sign up for one by entering your e-mail and creating a password. Sign up is free.
* Once you are signed up, log in to your account.
* From the "MY HOME" screen, click on "Settings." Scroll down and click on "Update diet/fitness profile" to input your height, weight, activity level, etc. Once entered, click "Update Profile"
* Go back to "Home" and click "Add Food" to input your food choices.
* When entering foods: Select your serving sizes and specify how many servings you need to consume for each. When you done, click Add Checked.
* Once you have entered all food items for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, scroll down to enter your water consumption in cups. Click on the green button "VIEW FULL REPORT (printable)." Cut and paste this report to your template, and adjust table size to fit on 1 page.

**<u>Important considerations for earning your grade score:</u>**
1) Make sure that your assignment is **readable and clear**. Use the template and save the final version of your assignment as a single **pdf file**. That file will ensure that what you see is the same as what the grader will see and that there are no glitches that throw off spacing and formatting.
2) **Accuracy of calculations and the numbers in Table 1.** Check your calculations!
3) Make sure the **food list is complete** and provides sufficient detail while being realistic, e.g. spread across multiple meals, includes a variety of foods in reasonable quantities, and does not rely on supplements such as protein powders.
4) Make sure the **target diet macronutrient totals for the day are within the target range.**
5) **Present explanations in a complete and detailed manner.** Each of the 6 foods changes described should be a ‘stand alone’ answer in that the information that you are conveying should be clear and obvious without having to refer to the question list on the assignment. **Be specific.** Indicating that something is healthier is not sufficient. Provide the details as to the specific nutrients and what it is that the nutrients do to promote a specific aspect of health.
6) **Do not** justify your foods for the target diet with a rationale that is not specific to the material in the textbook or class lectures.
7) Use the vocabulary of the course and not jargon, e.g. carbohydrates not carbs.
8) Do your answers make it clear that you understand and have mastered the material and concepts? Explanations, details, and examples help convey understanding and mastery of the material and concept.
