First in class quiz coming up on monday sep 8th

## Carbs as energy source
outcome of glycolysis is pyruvate  
this can then make lactate or acetyl-CoA

**lactate:**
- when glycolysis proceeds rapidly, pyruvate is pushed towards lactate

**acetyl-CoA:**
- goes to TCA cycle in mitochondrion ---> oxidative phosphorylation


### TCA Cycle

aka krebs, citric acid cycle

Electron transport chain, oxygen is final electron acceptor

## Fat as energy source

lipolysis: breakdown of usually adipose tissue, sometimes intramuscular fatty acid stores. Catyalyzed by lipases.

Fatty acids cleaved from adipose tissue and enter circulation.

Once fatty acid is transported, fatty acid is tranferred to acyl-coa (*not acetyl-coa*). then transferred into mitochondria and begins beta oxidation.

## Protein as energy source
- usually contributes less than 5% of substrates for energy production. Can occur during starvation or when glycogen stores are extremely depleted

Lab will explore cross-over of cho and fat utilization.
