assignment 1 due 9/7
we will spend time in class going over this assignment later

Field of study began around 1920 with discovery that both CHO and fats are used as fuels

protein products become available around 1950

1917 - development of the American Dietic Association

Lab 2 will investigate glucose vs fructose

### Macro
**Protein**
- Main contributor to growth & development
- Contributes minimally as energy source
- Enzymes
    - Proteins that catalyze metabolic reactions (eg. phosphorylase breaks down carbs stored in liver & muscles)
- Eg. Hemoglobin is a protein which carries O2
- 4 kcal/g

**Carbs**
- Does not contribute directly to grown and development
- Main contributor as an energy source
- Not a main contributor of metabolism regulation
- 4 kcal/g
- Monoosacharides
    - Glucose:
        - SGLT1 transporter
    - Fructose:
        - GLUT5 transporter
        - can be converted to fatty acids by liver, which may contribute to fatty liver disease for 
    - Galactose
- Disaccharides:
    - Sucrose
    - Lactose
    - Maltose (found in beer & cereal)
- Oligosaccharides (made up of 3-10 monosaccharides):
    - Found commonly in vegetables
- Polysaccharides:
    - 11-19
- 20 or above:
    - starch
    - fiber
        - cannot be digested by enzymes in stomach or small intestines
        - metabolized by gut microbiome
        - contributes to GMB (which synthesizes short chain fatty acids)
        - Soluble Fiber:
            - forms gel in GI tract
            - makes up 70% of fiber in typical diet
            - slows digestion
            - prebiotic effect, Soluble fiber fermentation benefits gut microbes:
                - Healthy metabolites (SCFAs)
                - promotes colon health
        - Insoluble Fiber:
            - attracts water
            - adds bulk and softens stool
    - glycogen

Usually over 50% of CHO intake is in starches (amylose or amylopectin)



**Fat**
- Does not contribute directly to grown and development
- Main contributor as an energy source
- Not a main contributor of metabolism regulation

### Micro
**Vitamins**
- Not a main contributor to growth and development

**Minerals**
- Calcium, phosphorus are main in bone dev
- Magnesium, manganese, zinc also assist
