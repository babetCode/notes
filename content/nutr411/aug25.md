No quiz today & no quiz next monday either

Goal is to get to chp 2 by wed & fri

if you haven't yet look at assigment

- Fiber:
    - Soluble fiber (reviewed last week)
    - insoluble fiber (reviewed last week)
    - resistant starches:
        - very green bananas
        - cooked then cooled starchy foods (rice, potatoes, etc...)
    - what does it do?
        - promotes satiety
        - slow digestion
        - lowers risk of type 2 diabetes & metabolic syndrome
    - should fiber be in pre-workout meal?
        - probably not due to decreased blood glucose spike, prolonged digestion

- Added sugars
    - cause spikes in blood glucose
    - cause spikes in insulin
    - Good when exercising or for quickly replenishing glycogen stores carbohydrate depleted
    
- Fats
    - important energy source @ low - moderate intensity
    - aids absorbtion of KADE vitamins
    - types
        - triglycerids (aka triacylglycerols/TG)
            - glycerol backbone with 3 fatty acids
            - short chain: 2-6 carbons
            - medium chain: 8-10 carbons
            - long chain: > 12 carbons *(What about 7 and 11?)*
            - fatty acids:
                - unsaturated (found in plants, nuts, seeds)
                    - double bonds
                        - cis: h atoms on same side of double bonds
                        - trans: h atoms on opposite side of double bonds (associated with low fat and heart disease due to increased LDL cholesterol)
                - saturated (in red meat and dairy)
                    - no double bonds
                - chain length
                - "less desirable"
                    - saturated
                - "more desirable"
                    - mono & poly unsaturated
                    - **complete this later**
        - Cholesterol
            - consumed in food but mainly synthesized in the body
            - dietary cholesterol does not have much impact on cholesterol levels
            - found in animal products
            - excessive intake can raise LDL cholesterol levels
            - precursor for all steroid hormones (incl. estrogen & testosterone)
    - after consumption lipids into
        - chylomicron
        - goes to liver and broken into:
            - VLDL ("bad")
            - LDL ("bad")
                - improved (lowered) by lower saturated fat intake, physical activity
            - HDL ("good") capable of reverse cholesterol transports, bringing plaques out of tissues.
                - should be above 45 for women, 55 for men

- Protein
    - made fo 20 amino acids:
        - amino group, carboxyl group, unique R group
        - 9 essential
            - methionine
            - phenylalanine
            - tryptophan
            - threonine
            - lysine
            - histidine
            - isoleucine
            - valine
    - Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS)
    - abbreviated version of muscle protein synthesis

- Water
    - ~60% by weight in adults, ~70% in children
    - ~2/3 water is intracellular
    - functions:
        - transport nutrients in solution
        - thermoregulation
        - medium for reactions to take place
