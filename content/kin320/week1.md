how do nodes of ranvier work?

## Force production
Almost always, more force is proced by more cross-bridges

### Type I: slow twitch
less crossbridging

### Type II: fast twitch
more crossbridging

### In general, IIx > IIa > I

Strength can be substituted for work??

## Force Velociy Curve

## Length Tension Curve

## Pennation Angle
What is serial vs parallel muscle fibers?

How does pennation angle adapt to exercise?

Why is there a difference between maximal force production fatigue vs. submaximal fatigue?

## Fatigue Components
- central factors (spine and brain)
- sleep deprivation
- ATP production
- etc...

## Specificity of training

## Overload Principle
- Applying periiodic stress to the muscles (1-2x/week)
