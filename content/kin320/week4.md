## Three Energy Systems

metabolism is approx. 20-30% efficient (70-80% lost as heat)

resting ATP stores last approx. 1-2 sec

Glycolitic encompasses both anaerobic & aerobic glycolysis

aerobic can use carbohydrate or fat

| | Anaerobic | Aerobic |
|-|-----------|---------|
| **glycolysis** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **lipolysis** | ❌ | ✅ |

anaerobic glycolysis (sometimes called "fast glycolysis")

creatine kinase catalyzes phosphorylation

glycolysis occurs in the sarcoplasm and produces pyruvate

in anaerobic, pyruvate is converted to lactate in the sarcoplasm

*make notes on krebs cycle*

ultrasound can scan for muscle glycogen

*what is the difference between lactate and lactic acid?*

*How much of DOMS is physical damage vs. chemical imbalance?*

**Oxidative System:** pyruvate is shuttled to the mitochondria and oxidezed in the Krebs cycle and  electron transport chain

| System | Max Power | Capacity | Time to Max Activation |
|-|-----------|---------|-|
| **Phosphocreatine** | 1 ATP |  | |
| **Glycolysis** |  |  | |

*How many days does it take to "carbo-load"?*
